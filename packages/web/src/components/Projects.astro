      This project is of course the site you're looking at right now. It's
      semi-statically generated with Astro (static with some dynamic bits) and
      I intend to over-engineer it to show off some skills I've been learning.

      This project is built with Next.js, tRPC, TypeScript, and Drizzle w/ Postgresql.
      It's a budgeting app for businesses in which they can track planned spend
      throughout their fiscal year. It's currently private, but if mentioned
      I'll be happy to share the code.

      This is a simple URL shortener I built a while back. It's built with
      Next.js and Node.js/GraphQL. The stack is a bit outdated but I think
      it still holds up well. I integrated with Stripe and used my hand-rolled
      authentication system.

      This is an experimental rewrite of edg.sh using Hono. It's a simple URL
      shortener, but this time built with Bun, Hono, TypeScript, React (SSR),
      and Postgresql. I was trying to experiment with Hono and see how it worked,
      and so far I really like it.
